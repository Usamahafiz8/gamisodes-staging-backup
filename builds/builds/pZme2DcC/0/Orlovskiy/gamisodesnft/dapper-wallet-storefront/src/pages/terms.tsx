              purchased NFT collectible cards.<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>
              Our NFTs are collectible virtual cards, in the form of individual&nbsp;cards, blind
              packs of multiple cards, and boxes of blind packs of cards.
              <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>The NFT cards have five tiers of
              card rarities, namely, common, uncommon, rare, epic, and legendary.
              <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Each NFT card has one level.
              <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Identical cards with identical
              levels may be merged into a single card with a greater rank.
              <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>If you purchase a pack of cards,
              you will receive 5 NFT cards: 3 common NFT cards, 1 uncommon NFT card, and 1 rare or
